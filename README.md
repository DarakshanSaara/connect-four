## 🎮 Game Rules
Basic Rules
Board: 7 columns × 6 rows grid

Objective: Connect 4 discs vertically, horizontally, or diagonally

Turns: Players alternate dropping discs into columns

Win Conditions: First to 4 in a row wins

Draw: Board fills completely with no winner

Bot Strategy
The competitive bot implements:

Immediate Win: Plays winning move if available

Block Opponent: Prevents player from winning

Create Threats: Builds multiple winning opportunities

Center Control: Prefers center columns for better positioning

Random Variation: Adds unpredictability to moves

Matchmaking Flow
Player enters username and creates game

System waits 10 seconds for opponent

If no opponent joins, competitive bot joins automatically

Random player starts first

Game continues until win/draw

```

## 📊 Analytics & Monitoring
Kafka Events
The application streams game events to Kafka for analytics:
```
type GameEvent struct {
    Type      string    `json:"type"`    // game_start, move, game_end
    GameID    string    `json:"gameId"`
    PlayerID  string    `json:"playerId"`
    Username  string    `json:"username"`
    Data      string    `json:"data"`
    Timestamp time.Time `json:"timestamp"`
}
```
Sample Analytics Queries
```
-- Most active players
SELECT username, COUNT(*) as games_played 
FROM games 
WHERE player1 = username OR player2 = username 
GROUP BY username 
ORDER BY games_played DESC;

-- Win rates
SELECT username, 
       wins, 
       losses, 
       draws,
       ROUND(wins::decimal / NULLIF(wins + losses + draws, 0) * 100, 2) as win_rate
FROM leaderboard 
ORDER BY win_rate DESC;
```
